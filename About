About:

This project is a simple room planner. 
User can draw wall segments or furnitures after selecting appropriate button in "Add Elements" groupBox. 
The user can also move an element by clicking on it with left mouse button and moving the cursor.
What is more application support rotating the elements (the user has to select the element, and scroll using mouse wheel).
The application support saving and loading created blueprints (I use Serialization to load all the data).
The application support two languages (English and Polish).
